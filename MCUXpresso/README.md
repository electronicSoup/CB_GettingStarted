This MCUXpresso page was added for Episode 12 of the CB_GettingStarted
series of videos on the electronicSoup YouTube channel
(https://youtu.be/ciJvPo9H7I8). It has just been added so that the
directory structure, used for the project, does not become too tightly
coupled to MPLAB-X IDE.

The project is targeted at the NXP Development OM13085 board
https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/hardware-development-tools/lpcxpresso-boards/lpcxpresso-board-for-lpc1769-with-cmsis-dap-probe:OM13085
To get the project to build two LPCOpen projects
lpc_board_nxp_lpcxpresso_1769 and lpc_chip_175x_6x will have to be
added to the workspace. These projects are available for NXP at
https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/software-development-tools/lpc-developer-resources-/lpcopen-libraries-and-examples:LPC-OPEN-LIBRARIES?fsrch=1&sr=1&pageNum=1


The schematic for the NXP OM13085 is available at
